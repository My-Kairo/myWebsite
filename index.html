          Paris is the city I would love to go to because it is the most
          beautiful city in the world, and it boasts rich culture and art, both
          in museums and galleries as well as on streets and in theatres. I
          would love to explore Paris by visiting the famous Eiffel Tower where
          I can enjoy the views of the metropolis. Paris is full of monuments
          from all eras and has all architectural styles.

          to communicate with people in Paris. Also it is the most beautiful

          second most useful language in the world for business.

              The Castle acted as local headquarters for the South African Army

              others a church, bakery, workshops, living quarters, offices,
              cells and numerous other facilities. The yellow paint on the walls
              was chosen to reduce the glare from the sunlight and also because
              it reflects the heat. Inside the walls of the Castle, are amongst

              The Hall itself is made up of components from all over the world.
              The honey-coloured stone, which makes up its façade of limestone,
              was imported from Bath in England. The tower houses a clock and a
              number of bells, modelled on the famous Big Ben. The clock strikes
              the hours and chimes the Westminster quarters, which is a
              particular chime originating from St Mary’s Cathedral in
              England.The tower houses a clock and a number of bells, modelled
